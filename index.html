        <h2>About the Movie</h2>
        <p>
          A band on the rise. A frontman lost to legend. Eddie and the Cruisers follows the mystery of Eddie Wilson’s disappearance and the music he left behind.
          Set to a hard-driving rock soundtrack, this film is both a mystery and a love letter to the music that never dies. Eddie and the Cruisers is part rock 'n roll mystery, part time-capsule heartbreak. A moody, underrated cult classic that asks what happens when a band burns too bright for the world to catch up. With a brooding lead in Michael Paré and a soundtrack that still slaps (“On the Dark Side” is pure 80s lightning), the film riffs on themes of artistic legacy, obsession, and the kind of music that lives longer than the people who make it. It’s imperfect, electric, and unforgettable, like the demo tape of a genius who vanished too soon.</p>
